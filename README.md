    <h1>MNIST Digit Classifier</h1>
    <p>This project implements a classifier for handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The classifier uses a neural network to recognize digits from 0 to 9 with high accuracy.</p>
 <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. It has a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. This project aims to build a classifier to accurately identify these handwritten digits.</p>
